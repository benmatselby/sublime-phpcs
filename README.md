Installation
------------

Use Sublime Text 2's [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control) (Preferences -> Package Control -> Install Package -> Phpcs) to install this plugin. This is the recommended installation path.

Or

Simply checkout the git repo into “~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages/ or the equivalent folder on Windows or Linux.

```bash
$ cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages/
$ git clone git://github.com/benmatselby/sublime-phpcs.git Phpcs
```

In both cases, you may need to then configure the following with the actual path to the application:

* "phpcs_php_path"
* "phpcs_executable_path"
* "phpmd_executable_path"
* "php_cs_fixer_executable_path"

They are optional for the plugin. The path needs to include the application such as "/usr/local/bin/phpcs".

In order to get the path of the application (On a Mac/Linux based environment), you can use:

```bash
$ which phpcs
$ which phpmd
$ which php-cs-fixer
```

FAQ
---

###What do I do when I get "No such file or directory" error?

```
OSError: [Error 2] No such file or directory
```

* Well, first of all you need to check that you have PHP_CodeSniffer, and if being used, the phpmd application.
* If you have these applications installed, then it sounds like those applications are not in your PATH, or cannot be found in your PATH by the Python runtime, so configure "phpcs_php_path", "phpcs_executable_path", "phpmd_executable_path" and "php_cs_fixer_executable_path" with the actual paths to those applications

###What if I've installed the applications using Homebrew?

If you have installed php-cs-fixer, phpmd or phpcs via homebrew then please make sure that you define the "*_executable_path" option to the .phar application and not the wrapper script that is placed in your bin folder, as this will cause odd behaviour.
